Tony + Joel, started on the website, included input fields and website structure. Will continue to work on the website to accomadate displaying search results.


Jodie, has completed one of her assigned tasks, Create function to restrict search to a price range, and will continue with createing function to restrict search to a distance range. Calculating the distance between a and b may take longer than expected


Michael, has begin work on implementing a map into the website, which will hopefully be ready to implement tomorrow

# Day [2] - Scrum Meeting summary


The Scrum Master for this meeting was Tony Wright


Members Present: Michael, Joel, Jodie, Tony, Dimitar, Ben


Members Not Present: none


Summary of Conversation: 

Tony + Joel, continued working on functionality for the website, after speaking to other members, we have changed the design to make it easier to identify which search options the user is wanting to use. Currently setting up the connection to the new database through netbeans and setting up a push to the github and displaying dynamic results depending on search options - Joel was having a few problems pushing with the IDE, although shouldn't take too long to fix

Michael - Completed template map, uploaded to github, waiting for dataset to be uploaded to the database to run further tests and complete functionality

Jodie - Completed 'Create function to restrict search to a distance range' task, currently setting up and populating the database

Benjamin - Has completed the majority of assigned tasks, just 'Create an order by distance function', currently continuing work on

Dimitar - Has been assigned to work with Tony and Joel on displaying the search results, also the task 'Display a combination of search results in one list'

As everything is on track, the goal for tomorrow is to start intergrating the search algorithms into the website to test with the database.


# Day [3] - Scrum Meeting summary


The Scrum Master for this meeting was Tony Wright


Members Present: Michael, Jodie, Tony, Dimitar, Ben

Initialially, scrum master reminded the group of the pair programming videos needed to be recorded (also a reminder of what they consist of) and a reminder of the plan to record the meeting tomorrow,

Jodie - Completed uploading all the data to the database, currently working on testing and refining stored procedures and testing search results

Michael - completed code for the Map, ready to test with the newly imported data, aim for the end of the day is to have the map working with the data and intergrate tomorrow.

Benjamin - Continuing work on the 'Create an order by distance function', taking longer than expected, however good progress is being made. Aims for the code to be complete by the end of the day, and to be ready for intergration tomorrow

Dimitar - Research on connecting the HTML and Java, intergration method to be completed by the end of the day

Summary of Conversation:

Joel - Has started working on connnecting HTML with Java, progress made and solutions have been found, however not yet debugged. Will continue working on a solution to be completed ASAP ready for intergration with Java classes.

jodie - soted procedures called using Java - Having trouble parsing the data recieved from the database - will continue working on connnecting the java with SQL

Michael - Map implementation with database input data, problems occured with the database working with the map, because of the large dataset. Will continue working on and testing the functionality

Benjamin - Distance function working, currently working on merging the Java class together ready for intergration.

Plan of action to merge all parts of the project so far:

Jodie and Ben, combine all Java classes into 1 that can be called by the HTML submit request

Tony and Joel, debug method of connecting HTML and Java classes

-Michael, embed the map onto the demonstration website, completed working search results demonstration

-Ben, prepare back end search results for the demonstration

-Jodie, prepare back end search results for the demonstration

         
After, we discussed the submission, what was required and organised what was left to do:

          -Tony + Jodie pair programming
          -Ben + Joel pair programming
